# HangMan-Game
This is generally a normal hangman game written in C language by using the application of file handling, dynamic
memory management (link list), and data structures. Which will ask the user a character and then match with
every character in the random word chosen by the program. And then it will print the character on the screen if
the character matches with one of the characters in the word. The program will run until the user press 5. If the
user presses any other number it will show the score and after pressing any key it will exit the program.
