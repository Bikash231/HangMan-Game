# HangMan-Game
This project is designed in WhiteStar UML software. This project have use case , class, sequence, state machine diagrams. On Wizard Land wizards are wandering about. Their goal is to learn as many spells as they can. The text of each spell is written on the wall of a cave. If a wizard wants to learn a spell, he must go into the corresponding cave and read the text of the spell. When a wizard wants to cast a spell, he must have the required amount of manna for the spell. Manna is produced over time by the body of the wizard. However, the maximum amount of manna a wizard can accumulate is limited. If the manna amount reaches this limit, the manna production stops, and is restarted only when the manna amount falls below the limit.
